    "Rik Gijsman is a coastal researcher and engineer who graduated (MSc) from both Delft University of Technology and National University of Singapore. He studied sandy beach dynamics at the Leibniz University Hannover (2016 - 2019) and completed his PhD on mangrove ecosystem dynamics at the University of Twente (2019 - 2024). His interest is in the morphological development of coastlines in response to engineering interventions and a changing climate. Rik is currently a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Twente and aims to support mangrove conservation and restoration efforts as well as their integration in coastal engineering practice."
